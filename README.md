### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2011

### Built Availability ###

There are no builds available for this custom device.

### Quality, Limitations ###

This code is low quality and not mature. Use at your own risk.

Despite the naming of this repository, the custom device is actually specific to the PXI-4072 and was only tested with the PXI-4072. Not all features of the 4072 are exposed. Some aspects of the custom device are not easy to use or parameterized as expected. The device needs a rework to be used with other cards reliably.
